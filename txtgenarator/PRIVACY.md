## Privacy

## Overview

This plugin, **Txt Generator Tool for Dify**, is designed to convert user-provided `title` and `content` into a downloadable `.txt` file encoded in UTF-8.

We take user privacy seriously. This plugin has been built with privacy by design, and it **does not collect, store, transmit, or analyze** any personal data.

## Data Handling Policy

- **No data collection**: The plugin does not store or log any input (`title`, `content`) provided by the user.
- **No external API calls**: All operations are performed locally within the Dify environment.
- **No tracking**: The plugin does not include any analytics, telemetry, or tracking mechanisms.
- **No third-party integration**: No third-party services are used. All functionality is self-contained.
- **No persistent storage**: The generated `.txt` file is streamed directly to the user and is never written to disk or retained by the plugin.
